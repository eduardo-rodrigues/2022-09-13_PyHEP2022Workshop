# The Particle & DecayLanguage packages

Presentation on the [Particle](https://github.com/scikit-hep/particle) and
[DecayLanguage](https://github.com/scikit-hep/decaylanguage) packages
of the [Scikit-HEP project](http://scikit-hep.org/)
at the [PyHEP 2022 workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2022)
on September 13th 2022.

## Abstract

An overview of the Particle & DecayLanguage packages is given. Particle provides a pythonic interface to the Particle Data Group particle data tables and particle identification codes, with extended particle information and extra goodies. DecayLanguage provides tools to parse so-called .dec decay files, and describe, manipulate and visualise decay chains. DecayLanguage also implements a language to describe and convert particle decays between digital representations, effectively making it possible to interoperate several fitting programs.
